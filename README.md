update 4/19 release 3.6

-Added a damage calculator for items bought and equipped. 
Example.- 
1) It will add damages for each avalanche and toss (lvl 1-4) and it also takes into account grow bonus damage on toss.
2) It also supports additional grow bonus damage to toss with aghanims scepter.
3) Calculates increased magical damage amplification with combo by use of items (note* does not calculate damage from items alone)
4) Finally, it calculates an average of %25 magical resistance most heroes have except for a few (for example: visage) so what you get in the end is a realistic damage figure your able to use to see if you can MURDER someone or not.  Accurate to +/- 50 HP

-Note* Working on bug that doesnt allow blink to function in custom combo menu.
-Note* Regular Combo integrated into script works 100%

Hope you enjoy the hard work and long hours put into this.  Big Thnx to Alfred.Xia and Kawaii for teaching and guiding me in the right direction. I figured it out in the end.  thnx Ya'll.
